Recipe Name: Kartoffellex (Potato Delight)

Ingredients:

* 4 large potatoes, peeled and diced
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 red bell pepper, diced
* 1 green bell pepper, diced
* 1 cup mushrooms, sliced
* 1 cup spinach leaves, chopped
* 1/2 cup grated cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or your choice)
* 4 eggs
* 1/4 cup milk or cream
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Fresh herbs for garnish (parsley or chives)

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a baking dish with a little olive oil and set aside.
2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté until they become soft and fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.
3. Add the diced potatoes to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender and lightly browned, about 10-12 minutes.
4. Once the potatoes are cooked, add the diced bell peppers and sliced mushrooms to the skillet. Cook for an additional 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are slightly softened.
5. Stir in the chopped spinach leaves and cook until wilted, about 1-2 minutes. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the skillet from heat.
6. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk or cream until well combined. Season with salt and pepper.
7. Transfer the potato and vegetable mixture into the greased baking dish, spreading it out evenly. Pour the egg mixture over the top, making sure it covers the vegetables evenly.
8. Sprinkle the grated cheese over the top of the egg mixture.
9. Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
10. Once cooked, remove the Kartoffellex from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.
11. Garnish with fresh herbs such as parsley or chives before serving.

Serve the Kartoffellex warm as a delicious and hearty meal, perfect for breakfast, brunch, or any time of the day! Enjoy!
